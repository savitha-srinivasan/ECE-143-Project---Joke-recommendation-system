## Dependencies

* [python](https://www.python.org/)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)

## Code organization
```
├── visualizations.ipynb         : Jupyter Notebook containing all visualizations shown in the presentation 
├── main.py           	         : Main file that runs both UBCF and content-based recommenders for a test user 
├── data_cleaning.py             : Contains code to clean data
├── normalization.py             : Contains code to normalize data 
├── ubcf.py                      : Contains code for the user-based collaborative filtering recommender 
└── content_based_recommender.py : Contains code for the content-based recommender 
```

## Setup and Running Instructions

1. Clone this repository   
2. Run the command: `python main.py` to see the UBCF and content-based recommender results for a test user. 
3. For visualizations, open 'visualizations.py' and execute the notebook.
